# Thesis-Documents

This GitHub repository contains all the experimental data and code generated for the thesis "Optimization of an energetic initiator ink for additive manufacturing through rheology and machine learning".

The specific files contain the following information:
- Appendix Mix Data: Excel file with all the experimental data gathered for the three methods for each experimental composition. Each page of the Excel document is for a different experimental composition, labeled with the sample ID.
- Mix Compositions: Excel file containing the exact composition for every experimental mix. Differences between medium and coarse particles are given to obtain the desired particle distribution for a given composition.
- drive-download: Several csv files containing data utilized in the machine learning code. Some files may be out of date and no longer in use within the final model code.
- GitHub Final Models: python code for the final generated machine learning models. The code was written using google colab, thus edits may need to be made to the file locations in order to run the code. The cells are divided into two main sections, one for the viscosity model and another for the printability model.
